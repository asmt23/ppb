["Democracy"][democracy] is a word one would certainly have come across if they had taken an interest in their civics classes during their primary schooling years. For a majority of the world, democracy is the standard system of government, and is quite often taken for granted. For many, it is just a normal part of daily life, without the question raised, of how things might have evolved through the course of history for systems and institutions to get to where they are - whether people like them or not. Though general trends point towards *more countries* becoming democratic, they don't imply that countries are becoming *more democratic*; these trends can [always change][demo-change].

In this post, we'll talk about a concept that is closely linked to democracy, but not necessarily the same: *elections*.
More specifically, we'll talk about elections in India, and what kind of voting systems would be appropriate in the current demographic context. Considering the open nature of ideas, there can be so many designs for [electoral systems][electoral-systems] - but not all of them would make sense in every setting. In the local Indian context, some options can certainly be explored that would make the "voice of the people" arguably stronger.

But first, we need to clear the air a bit about the words "elections" and "democracy".

## Elections and Democracy

One would be tempted to think that elections and democracy not only are closely related, but that one *implies* the other - but that is not always true. Since "democracy" literally means rule (*"kratos"*) of the people (*"demos"*), a democratic system would at the very least mean that there is some collective voice of the people echoing through the government. There are several ways in which it can be - and arguably, is, mostly - flawed (e.g. through [gerrymandering][gerryman], heavy polarization, or disenfranchisement of women voters in the past), but the bottom line is that there is at least *some* collective public voice that can realistically effect a change of government.

There is no dearth of places where elections are not held at all, and we won't go further into that discussion since the topic is not relevant for the discussion of voting systems. What is interesting, though, is that there also exist several examples of places where elections are certainly held - but the result is "somehow" already known beforehand, and a transfer of power is either extremely unlikely, or even impossible - such that people's expression of candidate choice is rendered irrelevant, thus eroding the "demos" from democracy. There are several means to achieve this setup  - whether through media capture, flawed institutions, widespread disinformation, or any other way - but the point to note is that democracy is not a given, and can [slide backwards][jod] if left unchecked.

Without getting into the normative aspects of democracy, if one were to ensure that democracy should be maintained in a given context, the fundamental aspect to consider is the robustness of elections in that particular context. And that means having a voting system that truly represents the voice of the people with regard to their candidate choice. It can be debated further that one can also vote for "issues" or "ideas" rather than candidates, but that is a separate matter and we shall come to that later.

Considering that we are restricting ourselves to the Indian context, we first need to understand the baseline of the voting system in India.
